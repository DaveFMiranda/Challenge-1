# Challenge-1
Accessibility challenge due March 23

## Description
This website has been updated from the original to be more accessible. Alt image text has been added, a title has been added, the code has been reorganized to make it easier for a screen reader to depict, and it now uses semantic HTML. I built this project to make it easier for people with visual disabilities to access the content on the site. I gained experience in some of the best practices around building an accessible site and updating an inaccessible site to be more accessible.
